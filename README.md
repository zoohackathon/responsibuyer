# Zoohackathon: Responsibuyer

The purpose of this app is to help increase awareness of illegal or harmful products you may find when going on vacation.

This application was developed on October 8th, 2016 for the [Zoohackathon](http://www.zoohackathon.com/).

Our app is live at http://responsibuyer.blueb.org:5000/. You can also check out [this demo screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) of our application on YouTube.

## Challenge and Approach

Our submission is for [Challenge #7. Decrease Purchase of Illegal Wildlife Products](https://hackpad.com/Zoohackathon-2016-Problem-Statements-DrI1FDhgStH#:h=7.-Decrease-Purchase-of-Illega).

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Develop an example Git repository
- Share it on Github
- Collect feedback from the community

Once we did that, we knew we were guaranteed to win!
